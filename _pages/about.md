Hello — I'm Qin Jingxi (秦境禧) , born and raised in Jinan, Shandong, China. I'm currently a fifth‑year clinical medicine student at Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat‑sen University. I'm passionate about research at the intersection of clinical medicine, basic medical science, and artificial intelligence (AI) , and I plan to dedicate my future studies to this interdisciplinary field.

In my free time I enjoy walking in parks and visiting museums. I also play the violin, though I rarely have the time or space to practice on campus; I hope to play more when the opportunity arises.

I will regularly post study notes and blog entries here about AI engineering, intelligent agents, and the intersection of medicine and artificial intelligence. Expect paper summaries, code walkthroughs, and practical experiments that document my learning process. Please follow for updates and feel free to share suggestions or feedback — your input is greatly appreciated. 🔬🤖
